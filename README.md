# Jekyll AI Related Posts ðŸª„

Jekyll ships with functionality that populates
[related_posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/) with the ten most recent
posts. If you install
[classifier_reborn](https://jekyll.github.io/classifier-reborn/) and use the
`--lsi` option, Jekyll will populate `related_posts` using latent semantic
indexing. 

**Using AI is a much better approach.** Latent semantic indexing seems
promising, but in practice requires libraries like Numo or GSL that are tricky
to install, and still produces mediocre results. In contrast, OpenAI offers an
embeddings API that allows us to easily get the embedding vector (in one of
OpenAI's models) of some text. We can use these vectors to compute related
posts with the accuracy of OpenAI's models (or any other LLM, for that matter).
